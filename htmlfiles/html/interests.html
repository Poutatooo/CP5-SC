<dd>Modern games do have an impact onto someone's life, I am interested in playing with either online, offline, indoor and outdoor games as long as it entertains me. It also allows me to escape stress and social depression for a brief moment.</dd>

<dd>Editing Photos is fun and all, but why not take it on a whole new level? Editing videos and photos is also one of my hobbies/interest as it kills time a lot faster and has something to explore with such as adding crazy effects and enhance all throughout my creation.</dd>

<dd>Have you ever wondered about your life while you're awake, some crazy ideas just rushes in as if they're possible. Well, it peaks my interest in life, and it allows me to move forward and expect something in the near future, imagining things is great as it could somehow alleviate some negative thoughts you have in mind.</dd>
