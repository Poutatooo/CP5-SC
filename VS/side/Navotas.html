		<dd>AFTER SAN JOSE DE NAVOTAS PARISH was canonically erected on July 1, 1859,
			the construction of a provisional parish church started in November of the same year. 
			It was in 1860, under the helm of Rev. Fr. Matias Naboa that the main altar was completed, 
			the cemetery was inaugurated, and the belfry was erected. Right from the start, 
			the parish boasted of a spacious churchyard.</dd>
