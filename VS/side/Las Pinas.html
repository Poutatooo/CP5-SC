        <dd>The church is commonly known as the Las Pinas Bamboo Organ Church, which is the Roman Catholic Church of Las Pinas.
            Its common name comes from the organ in site, because it is a pipe organ mostly made using bamboo tubes.
            Due to its excellent construction, it has stood the test of time.  </dd>
